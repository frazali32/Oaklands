# Finding-Replacement-Players-for-Oakland-A-s
In this project I will be providing a solution to the actual problem Oakland A’s faced in 2001 when three of their key players left the team. To find the replacement players,the general manager of Oakland A’s took sports analytics to the next level by inventing some new KPIs for finding undervalued but brilliant players . This strategy was so successful that they went on the win 20 consecutive games. This strategy was brough to the world in a book called ‘Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game’ by Michel Lewis. Later, this book was turned into a movie called Moneyball.  In this project we will analyze the KPIs that better account for the offence’s success such as Slugging and On Base Percentage. While finding replacement players we have following three constraints:
Combined salaries should not exceed 15 million USD
Combined At Bat(AB) should be more than the combined AB of lost players
Mean On Base Percentage(OBP) should be more than the mean OBP of lost players
